\section{Cost}

With the user base varying in size, so does the money charged for the servers. perispomeni.club, a smaller community, costs about \$7.5/month (as of 2017-06-10) with the domain adding another \$15/year, accounting for \href{http://perispomeni.club/invoices/}{around \$100 per year}. tilde.town on the other hand, being frequented by way more Swintons, is at \href{https://www.patreon.com/nathanielksmith}{\$89 per month}.

\section{Funding}

Tilde servers are funded mainly by donations. While perispomeni.club used and tilde.town still relies on Patreon, other servers like ctrl-c.club ask for Bitcoin or signup to their server host via a referral link.
