Tilde servers tend to disappear. If they do -- or rather, when they do -- t all the content the local swintons created and uploaded will vanish, usually for good.\\

When totallynuclear.club disappeared, it took with it the juke box made by $\sim$maze.\\

retronet is gone as well, and so is $\sim$qqwy's tilde-wide search engine.\\

Sometimes, at least the index page of the server is archived, like in the case of \href{http://web.archive.org/web/20141023063037/http://germantil.de/}{germantil.de}. Most user pages are lost, unfortunately.
